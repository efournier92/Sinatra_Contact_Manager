#Contact Manager (Sinatra) 

This is a project I did to practice changing a Sinatra application from using hard coded hashes as it's data source, to using a PostgreSQL database with Active Record. This was my first foray into dealing with the 'magic' that rails has to offer. 

###Concepts Utilized
* Adding the requisite gems to utilize ActiveRecord
* Writing a database configuration file
* Creating a Gemfile
* Creating a Rakefile
* Configuring an AR database
* Creating `contacts` table for use with the database
* Running Rake database migrations
* Querying the database I created 
* Writing a seeder file
* Seeding my database
